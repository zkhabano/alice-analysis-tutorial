Check your filesystem by opening\nthe Disk Utility application. Your main disk (whose name is Macintosh HD by default) should\nreport APFS as filesystem:\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Your disk should have been converted automatically to APFS during your High Sierra installation if\npossible.

Do you want to migrate your current\naliBuild installation? You already have the MIRROR directory somewhere on your laptop.\nIf you have followed the manual instructions, this directory is called:\n$ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR/MIRROR\nFrom outside the container, do the following: first off, move your current MIRROR directory\ninside the container:\nmkdir -p ~/alidock/.sw\nrm -rf ~/alidock/.sw/MIRROR  # if it exists already, get rid of it and use the laptop's\nmv $ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR/MIRROR ~/alidock/.sw/MIRROR\n\nthen link it to the old location:\nln -nfs ~/alidock/.sw/MIRROR $ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR/MIRROR\n\nThis will allow your laptop installation and your container installation to share the same mirror\ndirectory.\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Your laptop directory will link the container's directory.

The directory\n~/alice/sw will be created the first time you run aliBuild.\n\nNote that this directory tends to grow in size over time, and it is the one you need to remove in\ncase of cleanups.\n\nI don't have root permissions\nIn case you don't have root permissions, one of the possibilities is installing aliBuild under a\nuser-owned directory. Start with opening your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile (this depends on your\nsystem), and add the following lines:\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=\"$HOME/user_python\"\nexport PATH=\"$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\"\n\nNow close all your terminals and reopen them to load the new configuration.

When using this version, you\nwill only be able to submit Grid analysis jobs using ROOT 6-based builds (whose name ends with\n_ROOT6). If you still need ROOT 5 only for submitting Grid jobs, there is no need to install it:\njust use it from CVMFS by logging in to lxplus.cern.ch.\n\nOther build options\nThe options above are suitable for alidock or a CentOS 7 installation, since precompiled binaries\nwill be downloaded. You also have other installation options according to your needs: it is not\nguaranteed that cached binaries are available for the following options, but they may be faster to\nbuild.\nBuild AliPhysics based on ROOT 5 (legacy):\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults user  # without GEANT 3, GEANT 4, DPMJET\naliBuild build AliPhysics                  # no defaults; full stack\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  ROOT 5 does not work on macOS.

You can simply move to the build\ndirectory and run make (the alienv part is explained\nlater):\ncd $ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR/BUILD/AliPhysics-latest/AliPhysics\nalienv setenv GCC-Toolchain/latest -c make -j \n\nReplace  with a sensible number (e.g. slightly more than the actual number of\nyour cores).\n You lied. aliBuild is rebuilding everything! ü§¨One or more of the following actions might change the way aliBuild sees and uses the dependencies\nand might result in a full (or nearly) rebuild.

Do not attempt to load AliRoot and ROOT as well, you will\nfind them automatically in the environment! alienv enter is verbose and will inform you about the\nloaded packages if you have doubts.\nThe alienv enter command drops you to a new shell. Unload the packages by simply exiting it with\nthe exit command.\n I have several AliPhysics versions. Which one is AliPhysics/latest?aliBuild will tell you exactly what you need to type in order to load the software you have just\nbuilt. Just use aliBuild's suggestion in place of AliPhysics/latest wherever appropriate: for\ninstance, if you have several AliPhysics versions, AliPhysics/latest will point to the version you\nhave built more recently, not the latest.\n\nLoad environment in the current shell or script\nIf you know what you are doing, you can also load the environment in your current shell, and\nsubsequently unload it (this is not recommended):\nalienv load AliPhysics/latest\nalienv unload AliPhysics/latest\n\nIf you want to load the environment inside a script you are developing, just add this line (works\nwith Bash scripts):\nsource $(alienv printenv AliPhysics/latest)\n\nRun a single command in the environment\nYou can also run a single command (for instance, aliroot) in the given environment without loading\nit in the current shell:\nalienv setenv AliPhysics/latest -c aliroot myMacro.C+\n\n üö´Do not load alienv automatically in your shellEven if this is technically possible, it is strongly not recommended to load the environment with\nalienv in your ~/.bashrc! You must keep your environment pristine for safely running\naliBuild. By not loading the environment automatically, you will avoid a huge source of errors.\nDo you still find annoying to type alienv enter AliPhysics/latest every time you want to use it?\nYou can add the following line in your ~/.bashrc to make it more convenient:\nalias ali='alienv enter AliPhysics/latest'\n\nYou are creating an alias called ali, that will load the environment by just typing it at the\nprompt. Of course you can name it any way you want.\n\nSpecial build needs\nRead below if you have some advanced requirements for your local installation.\nBuild by using less resources\nBuilding takes by default all the available CPU and most of the memory of your computer,\nconsiderably slowing down your work. In some cases you may want to reduce the number of cores\navailable to aliBuild by using the -j  option:\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults user-next-root6 -j 1\n\nDo not use the cache on alidock and CentOS 7\naliBuild will attempt to fetch the precompiled binaries automatically in an alidock environment or\non CentOS 7: no need to specify extra options.\nIf you want not to use them for some reason, it is important you follow the CentOS 7\nprerequisites first: this will allow aliBuild to take as many packages as\npossible from the system. You will then need to add the --always-prefer-system option to the\naliBuild build command. For instance:\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults user --always-prefer-system\n\nBuild the same source multiple times with different options\naliBuild and alienv give you the ability to build the same development source with different\ndefaults without duplicating the source, and without conflicts.\nImagine we are under ~/alice and we have cloned AliRoot and AliPhysics with the aliBuild init\ncommand above. We build AliPhysics twice, once with ROOT 5 and a second time against ROOT 6.\nLet's first build AliPhysics with ROOT 5:\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults user -z aliroot5\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Note the -z aliroot5 command; it is assigning a nickname to the build for distinguishing it\nmore easily when using it.\nThe command ends with a message saying what to do to use the package:\nalienv enter AliPhysics/latest-aliroot5-user\n\n\nLet's now build the same AliPhysics with ROOT 6:\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults user-next-root6 -z aliroot6\n\nNow, the message tells us to type:\nalienv enter AliPhysics/latest-aliroot6-user-next-root6\n\nKeep in mind that:\n\naliBuild always tells you what is the package name to load at the end of the build\nyou can load the two environments separately, in two different shells, with no chance of a mixup\nyou have used the same set of sources for generating two distinct builds\nalienv enter AliPhysics/latest will load the latest you have built, which can either be the\nROOT 5 or ROOT 6-based version: given its ambiguity, do use explicit names instead\n\nIt is also possible to directly run aliroot (or any command you want) without \"entering\" the\nenvironment:\nalienv setenv AliPhysics/latest-aliroot5-user -c aliroot\nalienv setenv AliPhysics/latest-aliroot6-user-next-root6 -c aliroot\n\nThe aliroot command will be run with the correct environment in both cases.\n Migrating from ROOT 5 to ROOT 6While you are at it, if you want to migrate your existing code to ROOT 6 (and make sure it works\nthere) check out our migration guide.\n\nBuild specific releases (tags) of the software\nIt might come useful to build a certain tag of AliRoot and AliPhysics instead of simply pulling the\nmaster.\n\nNote that we only guarantee that the current AliPhysics master works against the latest AliRoot\ntag! It is therefore possible (though a rare occurrence) that the current AliRoot master breaks\nthe current AliPhysics master.\n\nIf you have your source code in \"development mode\" (i.e. downloaded locally by means of aliBuild\ninit), since your AliRoot/AliPhysics/O2 directories are mere Git\nrepositories, you simply need to cd into them and\ncheckout the Git version you want.\nFor instance, if you want to build AliPhysics against AliRoot v5-09-33, you would need to first\nmove to the AliRoot directory and check the version out:\ncd ~/alice/AliRoot\ngit fetch origin --tags\ngit checkout v5-09-33\n\nThen update your AliPhysics master:\ncd ~/alice/AliPhysics\ngit fetch origin master\ngit checkout master\ngit reset --hard origin/master\n\nand then build normally using the aliBuild command.

This of course requires that you have a working version of the ALICE software stack available on your computer. \n"},"analysis/classes.html":{"url":"analysis/classes.html","title":"AliAnalysisTaskSE","keywords":"","body":"Introduction - C++ classes\nAll the code that you will find in ROOT, AliRoot and AliPhysics is written in the form of C++ classes. A class is a data type which is defined by the user, and allows for creating data members and functions specific for that class. By convention, each class in AliPhysics, AliRoot, and ROOT, is stored in its own header (.h) and implementation file, which have the same name as the class it defines (so later on, we will see that your analysis class, stored in a file 'AliAnalysisTaskMyTask', is called 'AliAnalysisTaskMyTask'). \n C++ .... ?If you have never heard of classes (or C++), it might be a good idea to go through a C++ manual, an excellent one, with plenty of hands-on examples, can be found here: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/. \n\nClasses are extended structures which contain both variables and functions (which are called methods) as members. Often, variables must be accessed through these methods. This might sound a bit abstract, but it becomes much more clear when you look at in a small code example:\n    class Rectangle\n    {\n     private:\n      int width, height;\n     public:\n      Rectangle(int,int);\n      int GetArea() {return height * width;}\n    }\n\nHere we defined a class, called Rectangle, which has variables width and height, and a method called GetArea which gives us access to the members. \nInheritcance\nClasses are nice and important, because they can be derived from one-another (a feature called inheritance. Look at the figure below \n\nIn this figure, Rectangle is derived from base class Polyogon, and inherits its members. If we want to define a second class, Triangle, which is also a polygon and will therefore have features in common with Rectangle, we can also derive it from base class Polyogon. This  avoids having to repeat common code for multiple which share features. \n BewareClasses are very powerful, but inheritance can sometimes make it tricky to understand how code is structured!\n\nLet's take a look at how our classes would look like when we put them down as C++ code. First, we define out base class, the polygon\nclass Polygon\n{\n private:\n  int width, height;\n}\n\nThis example lives in 2-dimensional space, so our polygon is fully defined by its width and its height. The two polygons that we want to define, are a rectangle and a triangle. The rectangle can be defined as follows\n    class Rectangle : public Polygon\n    {\n     public:\n      Rectangle(int,int);\n      int GetArea() {return height * width;}\n    }\n\nNote that we do not have to define the members height and width here, as they are already defined in our base class! The only method that is specific to the rectangle, is the GetArea method. \nOur triangle class can be written as\n    class Triangle : public Polygon\n    {\n     public:\n      Triangle(int,int);\n      int GetArea() {return (height * width)/2;}\n    }\n\nAgain, width and height are defined in the base class Polygon, but also the Triangle class gets its own GetArea method. So now we have seen how inheritance makes our classes (and our life) simpler: by defining common functionality in a base class, we avoid repetition of code, which could easily lead to mistakes.\n Example from AliPhysics - The AliMCEvent classInheritance is used widely in C++ code, and therefore also in AliROOT and AliPhysics. Take a look at the AliMCEvent class below\n    class AliMCEvent : public AliVEvent {\n      public:\n      ....\n      private:\n      ....\n    }\n\nHere AliMCEvent is derived from its base class AliVEvent, in the same way as the Triangle is derived from the base class Polygon. Classes such as AliESDEvent and AliAODEvent are also derived from AliVEvent, preventing a lot of boilerplate (i.e. needlessly repetitive) code.\n\n Class headers ... ? C++ classes are, in code bases, usually split into a header file (extention .h) and an implementation file (extension .cxx). A header file is generally used to define all of the functions, variables and constants contained in a class. There are multiple good reasons for splitting code into an implementation and a header - can you think of a few? \n\nAliAnalysisTaskSE\nNow that you are an expert at C++ classes, you might wonder why classes are relevant to writing an analysis task. The reason is the following: in the AliPhysics analysis framework, all analysis tasks are derived from the same base class, called AliAnalysisTaskSE, where SE stands for 'single event'. This class in turn, is derived from the class AliAnalysisTask (if you are interested, you can go through the code and follow the full chain of inheritance). \nSince all analysis tasks derive from AliAnalysisTaskSE, all analyses share the following common, base methods:\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::AliAnalysisTaskSE();\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::AliAnalysisTaskSE(const char*);\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::~AliAnalysisTaskSE();\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::UserCreateOutputObjects();\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::UserExec(Option_t*);\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::Terminate(Option_t*);\n\nThese are methods that you will always need to implement. \nIn the following section, we will go through these methods in detail.\nClass constructors and destructors\nThe functions\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::AliAnalysisTaskSE();                 // class constructor\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::AliAnalysisTaskSE(const char*);      // class constructor\n        AliAnalysisTaskSE::~AliAnalysisTaskSE();                // class destructor\n\nare your class constructors and destructor. These are standard C++ features, that are called when you create or delete an instance of your class. We will later on see, why you need to define two different class constructors. \nAliAnalysisTaskSE::UserCreateOutputObjects()\nIn this function, the user (i.e. the analyzer) can define the output objects of the analysis. These are e.g. histograms in which you store your physics results. These output objects can be attached to the output file(s) of the analysis. \n Please noteWhen you are designing your class for your analysis, it (obviously) pays off to think about which output you need to extract the physics; do you want ten 1D histograms, or will four 2D histograms supply much more information? Or would you prefer writing certain information to a TTree, such that you have full information available when post-processing on your laptop? All these different output objects bring memory and size considerations, so choose well.\n\nAliAnalysisTaskSE::UserExec()\nThis function is called for each, single event over which your analysis task runs. This function is your 'event loop'. Examples of useful things to do in the UserExec() function:\n\nCheck if an event has properties that you want to have in your analysis, if not return;\nAccess the physics objects specific to your analysis (e.g. the charged particles in this event, or find the highest momentum particle)\nFill the histograms or other output objects\n\n Please noteIf the function AliAnalysisTaskSE::SelectCollisionCandidates(UInt_t trigger_mask) is called before you launch your analysis, UserExec() will only be executed for events which pass the trigger selection that you have specified. \n\nAliAnalysisTaskSE::Terminate()\nThe Terminate function is called at the very end of the analysis, when all events in your input data have been analyzed. Often, you leave the Terminate function empty: usually it is more practical to write a small macro that performs post-processing on your analysis output files, rather than deferring this functionality to the Terminate function.   \n"},"analysis/alianalysistaskmytask.html":{"url":"analysis/alianalysistaskmytask.html","title":"Your analysis task","keywords":"","body":"Your analysis task\nIn the previous section we discussed some of the basics of writing an analysis task from a 'theoretical viewpoint'. In this section, we will go through a working analysis class line-by-line. \nAs you now know, your own analysis task will be derived from the base class AliAnalysisTaskSE. We will use a fixed format to write our tasks, which means that we need to create three files:\n\nThe header file (.h) which contains function prototypes and in which your class members are defined\n\nThe implementation file (.cxx), in which the methods of your analysis are implemented\n\nAn AddTask.C macro which creates an instance of your class\nand configures it.\n\n\nThe class header (.h)\nLet‚Äôs start by looking at our header (the .h file), where we define the prototypes of all the methods that we want to implement in our class\n#ifndef AliAnalysisTaskMyTask_H\n#define AliAnalysisTaskMyTask_H\n\nclass AliAnalysisTaskMyTask : public AliAnalysisTaskSE  \n{\npublic:\n   // two class constructors\n   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask();\n   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(const char *name);\n   // class destructor\n   virtual                 ~AliAnalysisTaskMyTask();\n   // called once at beginning of runtime\n   virtual void            UserCreateOutputObjects();\n   // called for each event\n   virtual void            UserExec(Option_t\\* option);\n   // called at end of analysis\n   virtual void            Terminate(Option_t\\* option);\n  /// \\cond CLASSDEF\n  ClassDef(AliAnalysisTaskMyTask, 1);\n  /// \\endcond};\n\n#endif\n\nLet's to through the snippet of code line-by-line. First of all, we see\n#ifndef AliAnalysisTaskMyTask_H\n#define AliAnalysisTaskMyTask_H\n.\n.\n.\n#endif\n\nThese three lines form an include guard (sometimes called macro guard, or header guard). This construct is used to avoid the problem of double inclusion: should the header of your class be included more than once, the include guard will protect your code from double definitions which result in invalid code. \n  Include guardsWhat is the risk of not using include guards?\n  drum roll Click to expandSay that you have a header file, called grandparent.h, in which you define a struct\nstruct foo {\n    int member;\n};\n\nand you create a second file parent.h where you write\n#include \"grandparent.h\"\n\nand even a third one, child.h in which you do\n#include \"grandparent.h\"\n#include \"parent.h\"\n\nAfter preprocessing, the content of the file child.h will be\nstruct foo {\n    int member;\n};\nstruct foo {\n    int member;\n};\n\nsince child.h has indirectly included two copies of the text in the header file grandparent.h. This will cause a compilation error, since the struct foo will be defined twice. Using include guards, this problem would not have arisen. \n\nClass definition and constructors\nIf we continue looking at the code, we see the class definition and two class constructors\nclass AliAnalysisTaskMyTask : public AliAnalysisTaskSE  \n{\npublic:\n   // two class constructors\n   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask();\n   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(const char *name);\n   // class destructor\n   virtual                 ~AliAnalysisTaskMyTask();\n\nThe first line means that we define a class AliAnalysisTaskMyTask, which is derived from AliAnalysisTaskSE. \nClass constructors and destructor\nThe two functions AliAnalysisTaskMyTask() and AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(const char *name) are class constructors. A class constructor is a special function in a class that is called when a new object of the class is created. \nWe always need to define two class constructors for our analysis task, why this is, will be explained later. The third function is the class destructor. A destructor is also a special function which is called when the created object is deleted. We will later see, that a class that has pointer data members should include, in addition to a destructor, a copy constructor and an assignment operator - but for now we can just forget about those. \nAliAnalysisTaskSE inherited functions\nAfter the constructors and destructors, we define the prototypes of the functions that we have already seen in the AliAnalysisTaskSE section\n   // called once at beginning of runtime\n   virtual void            UserCreateOutputObjects();\n   // called for each event\n   virtual void            UserExec(Option_t* option);\n   // called at end of analysis\n   virtual void            Terminate(Option_t* option);\n\nThese functions will be the heart of our analysis. In the UserCreateOutputObjects, we will define whatever output we want to write to our root files. The UserExec function will be called for all events in the data sample that we are looking at. Finally, Terminate is called at the very end of the analysis. \n  Virtual functions In the code snippet above, we see the virtual keyword. Do you know what this means ? \n  Click to show answer Click to expandConsider the following simple program which is an example of runtime polymorphism.\nThe main thing to note about the program is, derived class function is called using a base class pointer. The idea is, virtual functions are called according to the type of object pointed or referred, not according to the type of pointer or reference. In other words, virtual functions are resolved late, at runtime (which makes them powerful, but costly):\nclass Employee \n{ \npublic: \n    virtual void raiseSalary() \n    {  /* common raise salary code */  } \n\n    virtual void promote() \n    { /* common promote code */ } \n}; \n\nclass Manager: public Employee { \n    virtual void raiseSalary() \n    {  /* Manager specific raise salary code, may contain \n          increment of manager specific incentives*/  } \n\n    virtual void promote() \n    { /* Manager specific promote */ } \n}; \n\n// Similarly, there may be other types of employees \n\n// We need a very simple function to increment salary of all employees \n// Note that emp[] is an array of pointers and actual pointed objects can \n// be any type of employees. This function should ideally be in a class  \n// like Organization, we have made it global to keep things simple \nvoid globalRaiseSalary(Employee *emp[], int n) \n{ \n    for (int i = 0; i raiseSalary(); // Polymorphic Call: Calls raiseSalary()  \n                               // according to the actual object, not  \n                               // according to the type of pointer                                  \n} \n\nOutputs  ???\nIn Derived\n\nSo, virtual functions allow us to create a list of base class pointers and call methods of any of the derived classes without even knowing the type of the derived class object. \n\nHistograms, lists, and more\nNow that we have defined the methods of our analysis class, it is time to add some members. What we are going to add, are three pointer data members\n\nfAOD which is a pointer to an event\nfOutputList which is a (pointer to a) list that holds all our output objects\nfHistPt which is a (pointer to a) histogram that will hold our pt spectrum\n\nSince these members are part of our class definition, we have to add them to our header file\n    class AliAnalysisTaskMyTask : public AliAnalysisTaskSE\n    .\n    .\n    .\n     private:\n       AliAODEvent*  fAOD;           //!\nIn the code snippet above, you might see something interesting: when we write comments that describe what our class members are doing, we prepend an explanation the expression ! to the double slashes that start our comment: //!. Contrary to what you might think, this expression mark is seen by ROOT (even though it's written as a comment) and it is essential for the correct documentation generation. We will get later to the logic of this locution, but for now a rule of thumb suffices: pointers to objects that are initialized at run-time (in the User* methods) should be marked with a //!.\nThe ClassDef definition\nAt the very end of our header file, we add the following line\n/// \\cond CLASSDEF\nClassDef(AliAnalysisTaskMyTask, 1);\n/// \\endcond\n};\n\nThere is a lot going on behind this one single line: ClassDef is a C preprocessor macro that must be used if your class derives from TObject. ClassDef contains member declarations, i.e. it inserts a few new members into your class; the ClassDef macro family is defined in the file Rtypes.h, should you be interested.\nThe two comments sorrunding the ClassDef statement are required to properly produce the documentation.\nHow all this works exactly is not very relevant at this point. We will later see that you will need to increase the version number whenever you change the definition of your class, or ROOT will not be able to handle objects written before and after this change in one process. The version number 0 (zero) disables I/O for the class completely, so we start counting at 1. \nThe implementation of your analysis task (.cxx)\nWe are for now done with our class header, it's time to move to the implementation of the class: the AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx file, in which we will actually implement our methods. Let's start by defining our class constructors. As stated before, ROOT requires two class constructors (we‚Äôll get later to why this is necessary), one of which is the I/O constructor, which is not allowed to allocate any memory. So we start our implementation with\n        AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::AliAnalysisTaskMyTask() : AliAnalysisTaskSE(), \n            fAOD{0}, fOutputList{0}, fHistPt{0}\n        {\n            // ROOT IO constructor, don't allocate memory here!\n        }\n        AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(const char* name) : AliAnalysisTaskSE(name),\n            fAOD{0}, fOutputList{0}, fHistPt{0}\n        {\n            DefineInput(0, TChain::Class()); \n            DefineOutput(1, TList::Class()); \n        }\n\nAs you see, n the constructor, we initialize members to their default values. Always initialize members to default values (and pointers to nullptr). If you fail to do so, values contained by the members will be random, which can lead to unexpected behavior of your code. \n  Undefined behavior You have written a small function\nint f(int x)\n{\n    int a;\n    if(x>0) a = 42;\n    return a; \n}\n\nWhat happens when you call\nf(10)\n\nand what happens when you call\nf(-10)\n\n?\n  drum rollClick to expandf(10) will return 42. The output of f(-10) is undefined, since variable a was not initialized. \n\nIn the second constructor of this task, we define what the input and output is that analysis class handles. In our case, the input is of type TChain, and as we will later see, the output is a TList. \nUserCreateOutputObjects()\nIn our UserCreateOutputObjects function, we will define the output objects of our task. These are commonly histograms, profiles, etc. In our specific example, we will add one histogram, and define a list to which we will attach the histogram. \n Output listsAdding all your output histograms to a list makes your life easier: the list will allow you to manipulate many output objects simultaneously. By calling TList::SetOwner(true), we transfer ownership of all memory allocated by the list items to the TList itself, this means that in our destructor, we can simply call delete list to delete all our list items, rather than calling delete for all items individually. \n\nThe implementation of the UserCreateOutputObjects method looks like this \n    ...\n    #include \"TList.h\"\n    #include \"TH1F.h\"\n    ...\n    AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::UserCreateOutputObjects()\n    {\n        // create a new TList that OWNS its objects\n        fOutputList = new TList();\n        fOutputList->SetOwner(true);\n\n        // create our histo and add it to the list\n        fHistPt = new TH1F(\"fHistPt\", \"fHistPt\", 100, 0, 100);\n        fOutputList->Add(fHistPt);\n\n        // add the list to our output file\n        PostData(1,fOutputList); \n    }\n\nNote that we create a TList and make it the owner of the memory of all its elements. After we create the histogram, we add it to the output list. Finally, in the last line, we call PostData, which will notify the client tasks of the data container that that the data pointer has changed compared to the previous post. \nUserExec\nThe UserExec is the heart of our analysis: it is called for each event in our input data set. First, we need to access our event, which we can do via ta call to the method InputEvent \n    ...\n    #include \"AliAODEvent.h\"\n    ...\n    AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::UserExec(Option_t*)\n    {\n      // get an event from the analysis manager\n      fAOD = dynamic_cast(InputEvent());\n\n      // check if there actually is an event\n      if(!fAOD)\n        ::Fatal(\"AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::UserExec\", \"No AOD event found, check the event handler.\");\n\nOnce we have access to our input event, we can e.g. loop over all the tracks that it contains, and store the pt of the tracks in our histogram:\n        ...\n        // let's loop over the tracks and fill our histogram\n\n        // first we get the number of tracks\n        int iTracks{fAOD->GetNumberOfTracks()};\n\n        // and then loop over them\n        for(int i{0}; i (fAOD->GetTrack(i));\n            if(!track) continue;\n\n            // here we do some track selection\n            if(!track->TestFilterbit(128) continue;\n\n            // fill our histogram\n            fHistPt->Fill(track->Pt());\n        }\n        // and save the data gathered in this iteration\n        PostData(1, fOutputList);\n    }\n\nTake a look at the code and make sure that you understand the logic of all the lines. In principle, this is all you need in an analysis task to run a small analysis. \nAlmost there: the AddTask macro\nThe last thing that we need to fully define our analysis task, is a small file, that we will call the AddTask macro, that instantiates our task (class), defines its in- and output, and connects it to the analysis manager. We will put this piece of code in an independent, third file, called AddMyTask.C. It is important, that this macro defines a function, in our case called AddMyTask, that returns a pointer to our analysis task. We need to follow this exact convention if we later on want to run our analysis in the automated LEGO train system. \nOur AddTask macro looks as follows:\nAliAnalysisTaskMyTask* AddMyTask(TString name = \"name\") {\n  AliAnalysisManager *mgr = AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager();\n\n  // resolve the name of the output file\n  TString fileName = AliAnalysisManager::GetCommonFileName();\n  fileName += \":MyTask\";      // create a subfolder in the file\n\n  // now we create an instance of your task\n  AliAnalysisTaskMyTask* task = new AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(name.Data());   \n\n  // add your task to the manager\n  mgr->AddTask(task);\n\n  // connect the manager to your task\n  mgr->ConnectInput(task,0,mgr->GetCommonInputContainer());\n  // same for the output\n  mgr->ConnectOutput(task,1,mgr->CreateContainer(\"MyOutputContainer\", TList::Class(), AliAnalysisManager::kOutputContainer, fileName.Data()));\n\n  // important: return a pointer to your task\n  return task;\n}\n\nAnd that's it - we now have our three files that contain a minimal analysis!\n"},"analysis/local.html":{"url":"analysis/local.html","title":"Running locally","keywords":"","body":"Running locally\nNow that we have seen how a task is built up, we will take a look at how you can run your analysis task.

This macro will \n\ncreate an analysis manager and data handler, \nwill define which data files to run on, \ncompile your code, and then \ninstruct the analysis manager to run your analysis. \n\nAn example of a steering macro to run the task AliAnalysisTaskMyTask on data that's stored on your laptop, looks as follows:\n    void runAnalysis() {\n        // header location\n        gInterpreter->ProcessLine(\".include $ROOTSYS/include\");\n        gInterpreter->ProcessLine(\".include $ALICE_ROOT/include\");\n\n        // create the analysis manager\n        AliAnalysisManager *mgr = new AliAnalysisManager(\"AnailysisMyTask\");\n        AliAODInputHandler *aodH = new AliAODInputHandler();\n        mgr->SetInputEventHandler(aodH);\n\n        // compile the class (locally) with debug symbols\n        gInterpreter->LoadMacro(\"AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx++g\");\n\n        // load the addtask macro and create the task\n        AliAnalysisTaskMyTask *task = reinterpret_cast(gInterpreter->ExecuteMacro(\"AddMyTask.C\"));\n\n        // if you want to run locally, we need to define some input\n        TChain* chain = new TChain(\"aodTree\");\n        chain->Add(\"/scratch/.../AliAOD.root\");\n\n        // start the analysis locally\n        mgr->StartAnalysis(\"local\", chain);\n    }\n\nRead the above code snippet line-by-line, and try to understand the comments. \nRunning\nTo run your analysis, it will now suffice to type in a terminal (after sourcing the AliRoot environment): \naliroot runAnalysis.C\nThis will trigger executing of the steering macro, which will in turn launch the analysis.

It has been up and running since 2002, to provide resources to store, distribute and analyze the petabytes of data that are generated by the LHC. \nOn the picture below, from http://alimonitor.cern.ch/map.jsp, you can see the distribution of computing centers that are working for the ALICE collaboration. We will the Grid to run your analysis on a larger scale than your laptop can provide. \n\nTo run your analysis on the Grid, all we need to do is expand our steering macro a little bit. In this section, we will explain how. \nConfiguring the AliEn plugin\nIn order to run your analysis transparently either on your local computer or on the Grid, we will use the AliEn plugin. The plugin hides a lot of complex operations that have to be performed in order to run your analysis on Grid, e.g.\n\nUsing all existing types of input data to be processed (root files, raw AliEn collections or XML collections) detecting their type automatically;\nGenerate XML collections corresponding to requested runs and/or data patterns;\nAutomatically detect presence of tags in input data and allow using tag-based cuts in a very simple way;\nAutomatically connect to AliEn (generate a token if needed) - still requires sourcing the environment file produced by alien.token-init;\nGenerate automatically: JDL, analysis macro to be run in grid, execution and validation scripts according a simple to understand user-driven configuration; \nCopy all needed files in user's AliEn space and submit the job automatically;\nStart an alien shell to allow inspecting the job status;\nDo automatic output merging and terminate the analysis tasks.\n\nThe implementation of the plugin is for the Alice Environment is provided in the class AliAnalysisAlien. In the following code snippet, you can an example of how the plugin is created.  These lines would go into your runAnalysis.C steering macro. Read through the code and the comments, and make sure that you understand what happens in each line. \n    // create an instance of the plugin\n    AliAnalysisAlien *alienHandler = new AliAnalysisAlien();\n    // if our class relies on code that has to be compiled, then we need to tell the Grid nodes\n    // where the headers can be found\n    alienHandler->AddIncludePath(\"-I. -I$ROOTSYS/include -I$ALICE_ROOT -I$ALICE_ROOT/include -I$ALICE_PHYSICS/include\");\n    // here we tell which source files need to be copied to the Grid nodes\n    alienHandler->SetAdditionalLibs(\"AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.h\");\n    alienHandler->SetAnalysisSource(\"AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx\");\n    // here we specify which version of aliphysics will be used on the Grid nodes\n    // only specificy the AliPhysics version, other dependencies (AliRoot, ROOT, etc)\n    // will be resolved automatically\n    alienHandler->SetAliPhysicsVersion(\"vAN-20160330-2\");\n    // here we specify where the input data of our analysis is stored\n    alienHandler->SetGridDataDir(\"/alice/data/2011/LHC11h_2\");\n    // and here we specify a specific pattern of filenames\n    alienHandler->SetDataPattern(\"*ESDs/pass2/AOD145/*AOD.root\");\n    // here we set the run prefix: use '000' for data, or nothing for MC\n    alienHandler->SetRunPrefix(\"000\");\n    // specify the runnumber to be analyzed. you can call this function multiple times with \n    // different runnumbers\n    alienHandler->AddRunNumber(167813);\n\nSo far, we have defined the following things\n\nWhich input data has to be analyzed;\nWhich AliPhysics version has to be used;\nWhat kind of analysis sources have to be used.\n\nThese are options that you likely have to change very often. However, there are many more analysis details that we can provide:\n    // number of files per subjob, this specifies how many input files\n    // each Grid node will analyze. For slow analyses, you might want to \n    // lower this number\n    alienHandler->SetSplitMaxInputFileNumber(40);\n    // the TTL is the 'time to live', which specifies how long a job can run, in seconds\n    // the longer you make this time, the lower the jobs priority will be. However, if the job doesn't\n    // finish within its TTL, it will be killed, so choose a reasonable number\n    alienHandler->SetTTL(10000);\n    // do you want to create a subfolder in which the output of each runnumber is stored? \n    alienHandler->SetOutputToRunNo(kTRUE);\n    // do you want to keep your jobs log files ? \n    alienHandler->SetKeepLogs(kTRUE);\n    // we can specify that we want to, later on, use Grid to also merge\n    // our output. to enable this, we will set 'SetMergeViaJDL' to kTRUE\n    alienHandler->SetMergeViaJDL(kTRUE);\n    alienHandler->SetMaxMergeStages(1);\n    // define the output folders, and give them a sensible name\n    // jobs *cannot* overwrite output, so make sure that\n    // folders with names as these do not yet exist in your AliEn space\n    alienHandler->SetGridWorkingDir(\"myWorkingDir\");\n    alienHandler->SetGridOutputDir(\"myOutputDir\");\n    // lastly, we give names to the automatically generated analysis scripts\n    alienHandler->SetJDLName(\"myTask.jdl\");\n    alienHandler->SetExecutable(\"myTask.sh\");\n\nTest of full mode ?\nWe are nearly ready to launch our analysis on Grid. But before we go 'full blast' and use thousands of CPU's, we might want to do a test run to make sure that everything is configured correctly (and to make sure that we do not misuse ROOT's streamer, which will be covered in a later section). \nTo test your Grid analysis, we can specify to the plugin that we want to go for a test run, rather than launching a complete analysis. In the code snippet presented below, let's assume that the variable gridTest is set to kTRUE. As you can see, we specify to the plugin that we want to run in test mode. We also specify that we want to run over one test file (if you want to run over more test files, you can increase this number). \n        // connect the alien plugin to the manager\n        mgr->SetGridHandler(alienHandler);\n        if(gridTest) {\n            // speficy on how many files you want to run\n            alienHandler->SetNtestFiles(1);\n            // and launch the analysis\n            alienHandler->SetRunMode(\"test\");\n            mgr->StartAnalysis(\"grid\");\n        } else {\n            // else launch the full grid analysis\n            alienHandler->SetRunMode(\"full\");\n            mgr->StartAnalysis(\"grid\");\n        }\n\nReady to go?\nWhen you run an analysis in test mode, a Grid environment is simulated locally for testing. Input data is downloaded from the file catalogue, following your configuration of the analysis plugin. After this, your analysis is executed. Running in test mode is an excellent way of convincing yourself that you have set up the plugin correctly. \nOnce your analysis test is finished, and you are convinced that your analysis output looks sane, you can submit your analysis to the Grid nodes. To do this, simply look at at the code snippet above, and assume that the variable gridTest is set to kFALSE. \n Do not forget your token!Only ALICE members with a valid registration can submit jobs to the Grid and access the ALICE data. To identify yourself as an ALICE member, you will have to make sure that you have a valid token prior to launching your Grid jobs, be it in full or in test mode. To obtain a token, do\n$ alien-token-init \nif all is fine, you should be prompted for your password, and see something like\n    => Trying to connect to Server [0] root://pcapiserv03.cern.ch:10000 as User \n    ...\n    Creating token ..................................... Done\n    Your token is valid until: Thu Apr  7 15:23:52 2016\nafter this, you are good to go, and can launch your analysis by executing your steering macro\n$ aliroot runAnalysis.C \n\nMerging output on Grid\nYou can check the progress of the jobs that are running on Grid by going to (http://alimonitor.cern.ch/map.jsp)[http://alimonitor.cern.ch/map.jsp] and clicking on the tab My Jobs, at the top left of the page. When all your jobs are finished (we will later, in the section AliMonitor look at tracing your jobs in more detail), you are of course interested in looking at the output that they have produced. However, this output is stored as thousands of files, scattered over multiple job sites. To obtain one, single file as output of your analysis, we need to merge all these thousands of files. \nMerging via JDL\nThe easiest way to merge your output is using the MergeViaJDL option that the plugin provides. Using this option will allow you to submit special merging jobs, which run on the Grid nodes and merge your output files. To enable merging via JDL, you have to configure your plugin as follows, before you start your analysis:\n    alienHandler->SetMergeViaJDL(kTRUE);\n    alienHandler->SetMaxMergeStages(1);  // just one step\n    ....\n    mgr->SetRunMode(\"full\");\n\nThis will prepare the plugin for writing merging jobs, when your analysis is done. \n More than on merging stage?By specifying\n   alienHandler->SetMaxMergeStages(1);\n\nwe tell the plugin that all output files can be merged in one go. \nIf your output files are quite large, you might want to increase the number of merging stages by specifying a larger number here: this will tell the plugin that we want to merge in multiple, consecutive stages.\n\nWhen all your normal analysis jobs have finished, we want to launch the merging jobs to Grid. To do this, we again make a small modification to our steering macro, and change the run mode from full to terminate:\n    alienHandler->SetMergeViaJDL(kTRUE);\n    alienHandler->SetMaxMergeStages(1);  // just one\n    ....\n    mgr->SetRunMode(\"terminate\");\n\nTo now launch the merging jobs, simply run\n$ aliroot runAnalysis.C\nagain. The merging jobs will be launched, and you can monitor their progress on via the 'Jobs' tab on http://alimonitor.cern.ch/map.jsp.\nWhen all your merging jobs have finished running, there is one step to be taken still, which is downloading the output of the merging jobs, so that you have your analysis output available on your laptop. This is done by again making a small change to your steering macro:\n    alienHandler->SetMergeViaJDL(kFALSE);\n    alienHandler->SetMaxMergeStages(1);  // just one\n    mgr->SetRunMode(\"terminate\");\n\nand running runAnalysis.C a final time. This will trigger downloading of the merged output files (the resulting files from the merging jobs) and a final 'local' merge of said files into one, single output file. When the process is done your high-statistics output files is ready - time to start writing a paper!\n Merging is 'dumb'Keep in mind: merging can be a memory-hungry process. During merging, all files that are to be merged are kept in random access memory. ROOT files tend to be heavily compressed when written to disk, so their size in RAM might be surprisingly large. \nWhen your output files are large, or if you have a large number of output files to be merged, you might need to merge in multiple stages, to avoid running out of RAM!\n\n"},"analysis/lego.html":{"url":"analysis/lego.html","title":"The LEGO train system","keywords":"","body":"The LEGO train system\nBy now, your code is running well on Grid, you're submitting and merging jobs like a seasoned professional. However, do you really want to \n\nStay up all night to resubmit jobs? \nRisk losing your code because it's not part of AliPhysics and your hard drive crashes? \n\nTo avoid these headaches, users are encouraged to run their jobs in a more automated and efficient way by using the LEGO framework. \n Why LEGO trains are crucialA train can easily contain multiple instances of your analysis, meaning you can run your default configuration and in addition multiple cut variations and other cross-checks. The success rate of the jobs is EXACTLY the same for each of your configurations, as they are all handled in parallel. This means that the all the configurations handle the exact same set of data.\nThis is in contrast to submitting your jobs one after each other (possibly running into quota problems) and having random job crashes, resulting in a situation where your default configuration and the variations did not handle exactly the same set of data.\n\nHow does it work\nThe LEGO framework is a tool to run and manage analysis trains on AliEn. It builds on existing infrastructure, the analysis framework, MonALISA and LPM. LEGO provides a web interface for users and operators which allows to:\n\nregister train wagons\nconfigure trains (handlers, wagons, input datasets, global Variables)\ntest the wagons and the train in a well-defined environment\nstudy the test results\nsubmit the train to the Grid\nstudy the resource consumption of the train for each wagon (CPU usage, virtual and resident memory) \n\n NoteThe fact that the trains run on the Grid, requires that all code is contained in an AliEn package. Therefore, the train uses the regularly deployed AliPhysics \"AN\" tags, so you will have to make sure that your analysis code is available in AliPhysics. \nWithin AliPhysics, your analysis code will be part of a shared library that contains many other analyses from your working group or analysis group. If you have never added a class to AliPhysics, ask your PWG or PAG coordinators for help.\n\nHow to access the LEGO train system\nThe LEGO train system can be accessed via (https://alimonitor.cern.ch/trains/)\n\nBy clicking on the top right 'help' tab, you will be guided to a webpage where it is explained in detail how you can join a LEGO train and perform a highly efficient analysis. \n Join the LEGO trains!Everyone is encouraged to use the LEGO train system for running analysis rather than running analysis by yourself on Grid. Not only will you benefit yourself, but by running trains that contain analyses of multiple users in one go, we conserve resources: the LEGO train has to only run on instance of AliPhysics to perform multiple analyses, and it has to only retrieve the input data once. \nAs a consequence: LEGO train jobs have higher priority in the job queues than user jobs! Furthermore, your analysis will always be reproducible, and you will receive a simple mail with a link to your final output file when your train run is done. So if you want to perform fast, safe, and efficient analysis: use the LEGO trains!\n\nHow to add your analysis task to the LEGO train system\nAs seen in the screenshot above, the train pages are grouped by PWG, collision system, and AOD or ESD data processing. Once you are in the correct train page:\n\nClick Add new wagon\nConfigure the wagon by either setting it up from scratch, or copying it from an existing wagon(available under advanced settings, and allows in addition to not only copy your own wagons, but also from any other user!)\nCheck that your macro is defined and configured correctly in the basic settings tab\nCheck the dependencies (if your dependency is not available you can just create another wagon and configure it accordingly then define it as a dependency for your own wagon)\nUse a unique filename for your wagon\nExpert mode: Add subwagons (easiest way to run multiple analysis with a single wagon)\nActivate your wagon for the dataset you want to process (if it is not available, ask an operator to add it)\nCheck the runlist of the dataset! (Do not blindly use the runlists which happen to be there, make sure proper QA is done such that only high quality runs are used for your analysis)\nAsk the train operators to start a train test for your activated wagons (each PAG and/or PWG has a different system, please ask the coordinators)\nCheck that the train test output is successful and take responsibility in debugging if there are problems\nIf all is ok, confirm with the train operator that the train can be started\n\nThis seems to be quite a long list, but once your wagons are set up it takes only a few minutes to get your analyses on the grid. You just need to wait for the email to announcing the completion of the run.\n"},"analysis/monalisa.html":{"url":"analysis/monalisa.html","title":"AliMonitor","keywords":"","body":"MonALISA - the ALICE Grid monitoring toolset\nALICE uses MonALISA (Monitoring Agents using a Large Integrated Services Architecture) for monitoring and control of its Gird operations. The AliMonitor webpage, that we have seen in previous sections, provides us with access to the MonALISA services. In this section, we will cover some of these services. \n VO registrationFor full access to all MonALISA serivces, make sure that you have a valid  certificate and ALICE VO registration!\n\nRun numbers\nIn the previous section, we have seen that data that are stored are identified by their run number. If you want to look up which run numbers correspond to a given data taking period, go to ALIMONITOR and click on the tab 'Run Condition Table' (RCT). \n\nA large table is shown - you can select a data taking period from the drop down menu at the top left corner of the table. As soon as you select a data taking period, the corresponding list of run numbers is displayed in the table. \n\nTo ensure that detector systems that you need to use in your analysis were functioning properly, you can check quality flags for all detector subsystems in the columns on the right-hand side of the table. The number '1' means that data taking was successful; to only display run numbers for which data quality is guaranteed for a given sub detector, type a '1' in the field of the first row of the table that corresponds to said detector (see the circle on the top right of the above picture). \nIf you scroll down, to the bottom of the table, you will see a button labeled: 'Show list of runs'. Clicking this button will open a pop-up window which lists the run numbers that are displayed in the table as a list of comma separated numbers. You can now easily copy these numbers into your steering macro, and add these run numbers to the analysis plugin. \n Which data format to take?You might note that, for all runs, data is stored in two distinct formats\n\nAliESDs.root: event summary data\nAliAOD.root: analysis object data\nin various passes. \n\nESD files contain full information about events, AOD files contain a subset of information that has been selected for physics analysis. \n\nunless otherwise specified, use is discouraged as data are very\nlarge\nAOD files contain information necessary for physics analysis and is the preferred format\nAOD files contain pre filtered collections of tracks, to be selected via their\nfilterbit. Always apply a filterbit selection when running on AODs, to avoid double counting of tracks!\n\nWhen multiple passes are available for a data set, this means that the data has been reconstructed more than once, with slightly different approaches. As a rule-of-thumb: take the latest pass, but discuss this within your working group!\n\nAvailable packages\nThe AliMonitor webpage can be used to check which software packages are accessible on the Grid nodes. In the menu on the left-hand side of the page, click on 'Job information', then on 'User views', then on 'Grid packages'. A large table will load, if the CVMFS status is listed as 'available', a certain software package is available on Grid. If it's listed as n/a, it is (probably) archived, and cannot be selected for analysis. \nKeep in mind: when specifying a version of the software stack to be used, to only  call ‚ÄòSetAliPhysicsVersion(‚Äú..‚Äù)‚Äô in your steering macro. The right dependencies are automatically resolved. \n\nDaily tags (AN) of AliPhysics are a snapshot of all code that is in the central repository at 16h Geneva time. The daily tacks are usually available on Grid in about two hours after the tagging. \nRun quota - how many jobs can you run?\nWe have to share computing resources, so the number of jobs that you can run is not infinite. To check your quotas, which limit both how many jobs you can run, how much CPU hours they can consume, and how much diskspace your output files take up, click at the menu on the left-hand side of the AliMonotir page on 'Job information', then on 'User views' and then on 'Quotas. \n\nYou will see the five job activity quantifiers that apply for all users\n\nthe number of files that you have currently stored\nthe disk space that the files take up\nthe number of unfinished jobs that you have in the job queue\nthe running time of your jobs, integrated over the last 24 hours\nthe CPU cost of your jobs, integrated over the last 24 hours\n\nIf you are over (one of the) quota, i.e. one of the bars is completely red, you cannot submit jobs. In case of being over the file quota, you have to remove files from your alien space. Job quota just require a bit of waiting. \nBe patient, when you are over your quota. Not all quota are refreshed instantaneously, it can sometimes take up to 12 hours before your quota are refreshed. \n"},"analysis/trouble.html":{"url":"analysis/trouble.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting - when Grid does not do what you want it to do\nSometimes, running jobs does not go as smoothly as you would like it to go. In this section, we will cover some basic troubleshooting. \nFirst off all: be informed!\nGrid operations are complex. Often, job failures are a result of mistakes of users, but sometimes, certain Grid sites experience general problems. To quickly resolve these problems, it is important that we clearly communicate problems. To do so, ALICE makes extensive use of mailing lists. You can self-subscribe to mailing lists pertaining to Grid operations by surfing to e-groups.cern.ch . There, make sure that you are subscribed to\n\nalice-analysis-operations\nalice-project-analysis-task-force\nyour PAG‚Äôs mailing list\n\nALICE also employes a more professional bug and feature tracking suite, called JIRA, which you can access via\n\nhttps://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/projects/ALPHY\n\nTroubleshooting 101 - what should you do?\nSometimes, you will see mails such as\n            `Dear experts,\n        All my jobs are going into error. \n            Could you check? Thanks!'\nbeing sent to the mailing lists. The experts can (and probably will) check, but you yourself should\nbe the first to take a look at why your job is not doing what you want it to do. The starting point is\n\nGo to ‚Äòmy jobs‚Äô on MonaLISA\nTake a look at the job trace and, if available, the stderr\nand stdout\n\nThe trace tells you exactly how your job was handled, from copying of files to Grid nodes, to executing the job, to checking if the expected output files were actually created. Stdout and stderr are the standard handles for the normal information and error information. Depending on whether or not the process actually ran, these files may or may not be available. \nIf you have checked your job's trace, stdout and stderr, and still cannot solve an issue, it is completely fine to write a mail to the mailing list. However, be complete in your message, specify what goes wrong, and provide some examples of job numbers. Do not kill your jobs! If the jobs are purged from the queue, debug information is lost. \n Debugging 101Heads-up: excellent actual debugging documentation is available at\n\nhttps://dberzano.github.io/alice/debug/\n\n\nExample: validation error\nLet's take a look at an example of troubleshooting. We have some jobs running, and check their progress on MonALISA. Unfortunately, we see that all of our subjobs, corresponding to a given masterjob, go into the error state 'Validation error'\n\nThe first thing to do, is click on the masterjob number, to get a detailed overview of the subjobs. This table allows us access to the trace and log files\n\nClicking on 'log files' leads us to a page where we can consult the log files\n\nand by e.g. clicking on the 'stderr', we can check the error information of our job. \n\nMmm, so the job crashed with a segmentation violation, and if we remember correctly from our programming classes, we know that this points at illegal memory access ... so we had better go to our analysis code, and check our pointers ....\n Can you spot the mistake? Below, we see the UserCreateOutputObjects and a snippet of the UserExec() methods of the task that ran and segfaulted. What is wrong ? \n    AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::UserCreateOutputObjects()\n    {\n        // create a new TList that OWNS its objects\n        fOutputList = new TList();\n        fOutputList->SetOwner(kTRUE);\n        // add the list to our output file\n        PostData(1,fOutputList);\n    }\n       ...\n    AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::UserExec() {\n       // called for each event\n       ...\n       fHistPt->Fill(track->Pt());\n\n  Click to show answerClick to expandWe forgot to initialize the histogram that we try to fill: the pointer fHistPt has value NULL\n\nExample: execution error\nLet's take a look at another example. We are again running our jobs, but now we notice that subjobs of a given masterjob start to go into an 'Execution error' state. \n\nAgain, after clicking on the masterjob ID, the popup window of subjobs opens. If we hover with the mouse over the ID of a certain subjob, an graph of memory usage over time is shown. In this particular case, we clearly see that memory usage increases linearly over time\n\nLet's click on the trace of the subjob\n\nFrom the trace, we see that the job was killed because it used too much memory. The fact that we saw that the memory consumption increased linearly over time, probably means that there is a memory leak somewhere in our code ... better go back to the drawing board. \nWhat is the perfect workflow?\nBy now, we have seen that we can run our analysis\n\nlocally, on some data on our laptop\non Grid, either in test mode or full mode\non the LEGO trains\n\nEven though there is no perfect workflow, it is generally wise to\n\nDownload some AliAOD.root files to your computer\nDevelop your task\nTest locally (fast, no internet connection needed)\n\nWhen this goes well\n\nCheck in ‚Äòtest‚Äô grid mode.

'\nare sent on the mailing list. Some unexpected errors are caused by misuse of the ROOT streamer. The streamer has been mentioned a couple of times before now in other sections. So what is the ‚Äòstreamer to begin with?\n\nThe ROOT streamer decomposes an object into its data members\n(serialization) and writes it to disk\n\nThis sounds more confusing than it is. Take a look at our class example from section 1\nclass Polygon\n{\n private:\n  int width, height;\n}\n\nThe job of the streamer here would be, to save values of height and width, so that they can be written to disk. \nThe automatically generated streamer\nROOT automatically generates a steamer for us, if we instruct it to do so. Remember from the earlier sections, that we put the following lines in our task:\n          // tell ROOT the class version\n          ClassDef(AliAnalysisMyTask,1);\n        };\n\nBy doing this, a streamer is constructed for us by invoking the ClassDef macro. \nCustomization\nROOT generates a streamer for us, but we have the task of customizing it. Customization means defining what data members should and should not be touched by the streamer. Customization is done in the header *.h) of a class, by giving specific instructions in the comments written after the declaration of data members (i.e. ‚Äò//‚Äô). Let's take a look at this in practice. \nCustomizing: ‚Äòmember persistence‚Äô\n\nPersistent Members (//) are ‚Äòstreamed‚Äô (copied/stored)\n        class SomeClass : public TObject {\n            private:\n               Int_t   fMinEta;     // min eta value\n               Int_t   fMaxEta;     // max eta value\n                  ...\n\n\nTransient Members (//!) are not streamed\n        class SomeClass : public TObject {\n                  ...\n               AliAODEvent*    fAOD;        //! current event\n               TH1F*           fHistPt;     //! our histogram\n\n\n\nSo if we would write the object defined by the code snippets above to disk, the value of fMinEta and fMaxEta will be saved (//), but the values of  fAOD and fHistPt will be ignored (//!).\nAdvanced use cases\nWe can customize the streamer in more sophisticated ways\n\nThe Pointer to Objects (//-$>$) calls streamer of the object\ndirectly\n        class SomeClass : public TObject {\n            private:\n               TClonesArray  *fTracks;            //->\n                  ...\n\n\nVariable Length Array, (so that not just the pointer is copied)\n        class SomeClass : public TObject {\n                  Int_t          fNvertex;\n                  ...\n                  Float_t       *fClosestDistance;   //[fNvertex]\n\nAll this is explained in detail in 11.3 of the ROOT documentation https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html\n\n\n Streamers and doxygenIn the second subsection of this tutorial, you saw that the streamer directives looked a bit different. This is, because we sometimes use member comments in header files for yet another purpose: creating automatic code documentation with Doxygen. Doxygen is a way of documenting your code inside the source code itself, by factoring special comments that will be ignored by the C++ compiler. \nDoxygen uses both //!\nFor more information, see https://dberzano.github.io/alice/doxygen/\n\nPitfalls\nWe started this section out, by saying that the streamer definition can be a source of confusion. Why is this so? \nLet's start by realizing when the streamer definition is actually relevant: this is when objects are written to disk or copied. If you run your analysis locally, your analysis task is (probably) never copied or stored to disk, ergo the streamer information is never used and specifying // or //! are equivalent\nIf you run on Grid, or on the LEGO train system, the situation is different, and the following happens\n\nYour task is initialized locally and added to the analysis manager\nThe manager is stored locally in a .root file\nThis file is copied to grid nodes, invoking the streamer\nAt the grid node, a fresh instance of your task is created\nNon-persistent members are initialized to their default values found\nin the empty I/O constructor (remember that we said in Section 3: you always need to specify an empty I/O constructor for your classes!)\nPersistent members are read from the .root file\n\n Example 1 - 'unexpected' behaviorTake a look at the class below\n    class SomeClass : public TObject \n        Int_t   fAbsEta; //!\n        // setter\n        SetAbsEta(Float_t eta) {fAbsEta = eta;}\n\n        // ROOT IO constructor\n    SomeClass::SomeClass() : \n    fAbsEta(0) {;}\n\n\nIn your steering macro, you call\n    SomeClass->SetAbsEta(3);\nYou now launch your analysis to run on the Grid. What is the value of fAbsEta when the analysis starts to run at a Grid node?\n Click to show answerClick to expandAfter copying (e.g. to grid) the value of fAbsEta = 0. The member is not persistent (//!), so after copying, the value of fAbsEta will be equal to its default value as specified in the I/O constructor of your class.\n\n Example 2 - expected behavior?Now take a look at a second, very similar class:\n    class SomeClass : public TObject \n        Int_t   fAbsEta; //\n        // setter\n        SetAbsEta(Float_t eta) {fAbsEta = eta;}\n\n        // ROOT IO constructor\n    SomeClass::SomeClass() : \n    fAbsEta(0) {;}\n\nAgain, we call\n    SomeClass->SetAbsEta(3);\n\nAnd launch our analysis task on the Grid. What is the value of fAbsEta when your task starts to run on a Grid node? \n Click to show answerClick to expandAfter copying (e.g. to grid) fAbsEta = 3. The member is declared as persistent, so the value it has is retained. \n\nSo you see, that the streamer can have quite an important effect on your analysis!\nRuntime\nWhen you launch your analysis to Grid, it's important to realize that some methods of your analysis task are called on your laptop when you execute your steering macro, whereas other methods are only called on the Grid nodes. The execution on Grid is what we call runtime. \nLooking at the functions of our analysis task, we can e.g. say that \n      // constructor: called locally\n      AliAnalysisMyTask(const char*);\n\n      // function called once at RUNTIME\n      virtual void UserCreateOutputObjects();\n\n      // functions for each event at RUNTIME\n      virtual void UserExec(Option_t*);\n\nIt makes no sense to make data members that are initialized at runtime persistent. Therefore, as a rule-of-thumb, for all your output histograms, use the flag for non-persistence, i.e.\n      TH1F*       fHistPt;        //! pt histo\n\nAutomatic Schema Evolution\nIf you develop your code, the layout of persistent members of your class probably changes, i.e.\nclass Polygon\n{\n private:\n  int width;\n}\n\nwhich would take up 4 bytes, could change to \nclass Polygon\n{\n private:\n  int width, height;\n}\n\nwhich would take up 8 bytes when written to disk. The ClassDef value of your class bookkeeps this evolution for ROOT and avoids compatibility problems such as\n   `The StreamerInfo of class AliAnalysisTaskMyTask\n   has the same version (=1) as the active class but a \n   different checksum.  Do not try to write, ..., \n   the files will not be readable.'\nIf you commit your code to AliPhysics (or AliROOT), you should make sure to increment the ClassDef value when you change the list of persistent members, i.e. if we have a class\n            class SomeClass : public TObject {\n                private:\n                   Int_t   fAbsEta;     // min eta value\n                      ...\n            ClassDef(SomeClass, 1);\n\nand we add a persistent member, we have to increment to ClassDef value\n             class SomeClass : public TObject {\n                private:\n                   Int_t   fMinEta;     // min eta value\n                   Int_t   fMaxEta;     // max eta value\n                ...\n            ClassDef(SomeClass, 2);\n\nIf the list of non-persistent members changes, e.g. when we change\n            class SomeClass : public TObject {\n                private:\n                   Int_t   fAbsEta;     //! min eta value\n                      ...\n            ClassDef(SomeClass, 1);\n\ninto   \n             class SomeClass : public TObject {\n                private:\n                   Int_t   fMinEta;     //! min eta value\n                   Int_t   fMaxEta;     //! max eta value\n                ...\n            ClassDef(SomeClass, 1);\n\nwe do not have to increment the ClassDef value, because the streamer definition of the class does not change.             \n"},"analysis/destructor.html":{"url":"analysis/destructor.html","title":"Destructors","keywords":"","body":"Destructors\nWe are at the end of the manual for writing a task, but we forgot to implement one important aspect of our analysis task: the destructor, copy constructor and assignment operator.

Leaks are bad: they waste resources and can crash your system, and for that reason, we should implement a destructor\nSuppose we have a constructor that looks like this\n    MyClass::MyClass()\n    {\n      n = new int;\n      p = new float;\n      x = new float[5];\n    }\n\nThe destructor should be\n    MyClass::~MyClass()\n    {\n      delete n;\n      delete p;\n      delete[] x;\n    }\n\nOur life is not so easy however: \n\nWe did not allocate memory in the class constructor but in\nUserCreateOutputObjects\n\nWe might want to free that memory, but what if\nUserCreateOutputObjects was not called? ‚Äîif it hasn‚Äôt, freeing\nthe memory will cause serious problems (the infamous ‚Äòglibc double\nfree or corruption‚Äô)\n\nTo avoid this, initialize our pointers to NULL in the member\ninitialization list\n     ...\n    AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::AliAnalysisTaskMyTask() : AliAnalysisTaskSE(), \n        fAOD(0), fOutputList(0), fHistPt(0)\n    {\n        // ROOT IO constructor, don't allocate memory here!\n    }\n     ...\n\n\nWith our pointers initialized to NULL, we can go ahead and write our\ndestructor\n\n    AliAnalysisMyTask::~AliAnalysisMyTask()\n    {\n      if(fOutputList) delete fOutputList;\n    }\n\n\nA little trick we applied is\nfOutputList->SetOwner(kTRUE);\nwhich tells the destructor of TList* to delete all objects added to\nit\n\nNote that fAOD is not deleted - this pointer points to memory that\nwas not allocated by our task\n\n\n new - deleteRule of thumb: all calls to new should be accompanied by a call to\ndelete somewhere in your code\n\nDestructors and PROOF\nIf you run on PROOF, your analysis class is not the owner of its output list. A little trick to avoid segmentation violations when running on PROOF is to write\n    AliAnalysisMyTask::~AliAnalysisMyTask()\n    {\n      if(AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager()->GetAnalysisType()\n        != AliAnalysisManager::kProofAnalysis) delete fOutputList;\n    }\n\nThis only deletes the output list if you‚Äôre not running PROOF. \nCopy constructor and assignment operator\nSometimes in AliRoot code you see copy constructors and assignment operators (these two always go together). In principle, we don‚Äôt need them because our analysis class is never copied (apart from the streamer actions, which do not rely on these constructors). However, you might occasionally see compiler warnings such as\n     warning: 'class AliAnalysisTaskMyTask' has pointer \n     data members but does not override 'AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(const\n     AliAnalysisTaskMyTask&)' or 'operator=(const AliAnalysisTaskMyTask&)' \n     [-Weffc++]\"\nGenerally, these can be squashed by defining prototypes \n    private:\n      // not implemented\n      AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(const AliAnalysisTaskMyTask&); \n      AliAnalysisTaskMyTask& operator=(const AliAnalysisTaskMyTask&);\n\nDefining these functions as private implicates that we do not have provide an implementation. \nSo what does this mean, what are copy constructors and assignment operators, why do I need them, and how can I get them? If you are interested in this, keep reading. \nIn a nutshell:\n        MyObject A;      // initialization by default constructor\n        MyObject B(A);   // initialization by copy constructor\n        MyObject C = A;  // Also initialization by copy constructor\n        B = C;           // assignment by copy assignment operator\n\nThe copy constructor and assignment operator are automatically generated, but if your class has pointer members, they need to be customized (this is not a ROOT feature, just c++!). \nIf we wanted to implement our own copy constructor for our class, here is what it would look like\n    AliAnalysisMyTask::AliAnalysisMyTask\n      (const AliAnalysisMyTask& other) : AliAnalysisTaskSE(other),\n      fOutputList(NULL), fHistPt(NULL)\n    {\n      if(other.fOutputList) fOutputList = (TList*)other.fOutputList->Clone();\n      if(other.fHistPt) fHistPt = new TH1F(*other.fHistPt);\n    }\n\n\nOperating on NULL pointers is not allowed and the code will crash if\nyou attempt to do that\n\nOperating on uninitialized pointers is undefined and much more\ndangerous\n\nThe TH1F and most ROOT histogram classes have public copy\nconstructors, so we can use them\n\nThe TList copy constructor is private, so we need to make a Clone of\nit instead\n\n\nThe assignment operator is very similar to the copy constructor, but it has the additional requirements for checking for self-assignment and returning a value. In our case, it could look like\n    AliAnalysisMyTask& AliAnalysisMyTask::operator=\n      (const AliAnalysisMyTask& other)\n    {\n      if(&other == this) return *this;\n      outputlist = NULL;\n      fHistPt = NULL;\n      AliAnalysisTaskSE::operator=(other);\n      if(other.fOutputList) fOutputList = (TList*)other.fOutputList->Clone();\n      if(other.fHistPt) fHistPt = new TProfile(*other.fHistPt);\n      return *this;\n    }\n\n"},"analysis/":{"url":"analysis/","title":"Analysis tutorial exercises","keywords":"","body":"Writing a mini-analysis\nIn the following exercises, you will write a very small, but realistic, data analysis from the grounds up.

To obtain the source code of this analysis, choose one of the following two options: \n\nClone the Git repository. Programmers use version control systems when developing their code. You will also use version control (in our case through Git) when you are contributing to the ALICE code base. So why not start with Git right now? You can clone the example task repository, which you can find it on here, by typing, in a terminal\n\ngit clone https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial.git\n\nThis will clone the remote repository, so that you have access to a carbon copy of the full repository on your local computer. \n\nA more robust approach to working with Git, is creating a remote fork of a certain repository, and working on this fork. For this, you will need to open a GitHub [https://github.com/] account (which you will need in any case if you want to contribute to ALICE software). If you have a GitHub account, you create a fork of the example task repository by surfing here and clicking on fork at the top right of the screen. If you have forked the repository, you can proceed to cloning it on your laptop in the way as explained in option 1; this then allows you to develop the code, and push commits to your own fork\n\nWhichever approach you chose, the end result should be that you have stored these files on your laptop. One word of caution:  the path in which you store these files cannot contain spaces! E.g. /home/my  task/ will not work, use /home/my_task/  .\nA first look at your task\nAs a start, just take a look at code that makes up the task:\n\nAliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx\n\nAliAnalysisTaskMyTask.h\n\nAddMyTask.C\n\nrunAnalysis.C\n\n\nYou will see that the code is extensively documented.

This input file is called AliAOD.root, short for Analysis Object Data. In the following steps, will assume that we are looking at Pb-Pb data that was taken in 2015. You can also choose to run on data from a different period or collision system.  \nSource your environment\nWe will get the data form the ALICE file catalogue. To access the file catalogue, you will need to use AliEn-Runtime and have a valid Grid certificate. This means that, at this point, we will assume that you have built all the ALICE software (see our build manual for that ).\nLoad your ALICE environment as explained here, e.g. by doing\nalienv enter AliPhysics::latest\nYou should see which module files are currently loaded, e.g.\n  1) BASE/1.0\n  2) GCC-Toolchain/v6.2.0-alice1-1\n  3) AliEn-Runtime/v2-19-le-1\n  4) GSL/v1.16-1\n  5) Python-modules/1.0-1\n  6) ROOT/v6-10-06+git_c54db1c10b-1\n  7) boost/v1.59.0-1\n  8) cgal/v4.6.3-1\n  9) fastjet/v3.2.1_1.024-alice1-1\n 10) Vc/1.3.2-1\n 11) AliRoot/0742e9dc6e12c74634a1e353ab00ceba45335401_ROOT6-1\n 12) AliPhysics/latest\nUse alienv list to list loaded modules.

This is step one towards becoming a professional physicist (no turning back from here ... ) If it didn‚Äôt work, ask for help.

What we will do is\n\nAdd some event selection criteria\n\nAdd some track selection criteria\n\n\nBut let‚Äôs not go too fast.\nThe event loop\nCollisions are referred to as ‚Äòevents‚Äô. In our analysis task, the function \nAliAnalysisTaskSE::UserExec\nis called once for each event in the input data set. You never have to explicitly call this function yourself ! Remember, from programming 101 classes, the lecture about inheritance in C++? The UserExec function is called by a base class that you do not have to worry about. We will later see that this function is only called when an event passes your trigger selection. \nFun !\nIt‚Äôs time to add some code to our task. First, create additional output histograms in which you‚Äôll store\n\nThe primary vertex positions along the beam line for all events\n\nJust like the example histogram fHistPt, you have to add these histograms as members of your class. So: create the pointers in the header file, remember to initialize the pointers in your class constructors, and don‚Äôt forget to create instances of the histograms in the UserCreateOutput method.\nOne of the trickiest things in programming can be finding out what methods to use out of millions of lines of code. To help you out, here's a line of code to obtain the vertex position along the beam line\nfloat vertexZ = fAOD->GetPrimaryVertex()->GetZ();\n\nYou can of course just copy-paste these lines into your task and hope that it works, but try to think of\n\ndo you understand the logic of these lines?\n\ncan you find out in which classes these methods are defined?\n\n\nTry to run the code again, after you‚Äôve added these histograms.\nAll set?\nIt‚Äôs almost time to run the modified analysis. Not all collisions in the detector are actually usable for physics analysis. Events which happen very far from the center of the detector, for example, are usually not used for analysis (any idea why?). To make sure that we only look at high quality data, we do ‚Äôevent selection‚Äô. Let‚Äôs add some event selection criteria to your task.\n\nModify the code such that only primary vertices are accepted within 10 cm of detector center. Such selections in the event sample or track sample are usually referred to as ‚Äòcuts‚Äô. \nGenerally, we want to see how much data we ‚Äòthrow away‚Äô when applying a cut. How would you go about doing that?\n\nBesides rejecting data via cuts, we also make data selection while data taking, by ‚Äòtriggering‚Äô: selecting collisions in which we expect certain processes to have occurred. You can check which triggers are selected in the AddMyTask.C macro , where we call\n    task->SelectCollisionCandidates(AliVEvent::kAnyINT);\nAs you can see, trigger classes are defined in the class AliVEvent.

In addition to ‚Äôevent cuts‚Äô, we therefore have to apply ‚Äôtrack cuts‚Äô as well. In ALICE, we usually use a system of predefined track selection criteria, that are checked by reading the filterbit of a track. \n\nCheck in the code where the filterbit selection is done\n\nChange the filterbit selection from value 1 to 128 to 512\n\n\nHow does your eta, phi distribution change, if you run your task again with filterbit 512? What do you think is the cause of the difference? Keep in mind for later, that you will have to choose your filterbit selection wisely, different types of analyses need different track selections. Discuss with your colleagues, working group or supervisor to decide on what would be best for your analysis. \nTIP\n\nIf you ran your task again, you have - most likely - overwritten the output of the previous run, which makes it hard to compare the distributions obtained with the different filterbits - it can be useful to keep all output files you generate on a safe place on your hard drive\n\n... if you keep the files make sure that you will remember which event and track selections you used. In a few weeks, you have probably forgotten which filterbit was set for a certain output file. You can create readme files, or add a histogram as bookkeeping device.\n\n\n"},"analysis/pid.html":{"url":"analysis/pid.html","title":"Step 5 -Particle identification","keywords":"","body":"Step 5\nIn this section, we‚Äôll try to identify particles, by using the amount of energy they have lost per distance traveled in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). Some specific technical information on how to implement this in your task is given at the end of this document, but general steps to follow are explained here. First, the goals. What we want to do is\n\nidentify pions\n\ncheck how ‚Äôpure‚Äô our pion sample is\n\n\nWe‚Äôll do this by looking at the TPC signal, and seeing how well this signal corresponds to the expected signal for a certain particle species. Look at the figure for clarification, you see lines (the expected signal a particle leaves in the TPC, ‚Äòthe hypothesis‚Äô) and in colors, the actual signals that were deposited.\n\nStart by storing the TPC signals for all charged particles in your events, in a two-dimensional histogram (such as shown in the figure). First follow the ‚Äôtechnical steps‚Äô from Sec. 8, and then try to make such a plot.\nHint, you can get this information by doing\nfYour2DHistogram->Fill(track->P(), track->GetTPCsignal());\n\nIf your histogram is empty after running, try using Filterbit 1 rather than 128.\nAs a second step, you identify particles, and store only the TPC signal that corresponds to pions. \nBEFORE YOU START ...\nTo speed things up a bit, the code that you will need for this exercise is given and explained here. It is recommended to read the entire section prior to implementing the methods.  \nTo identify particles, you will add an additional task to your analysis, the ‚ÄòPID response‚Äô task. This task makes sure that parametrizations that we use for e.g. specific energy loss in the TPC are loaded. To add this task to your analysis, open your runAnalysis.C macro, and add the following lines. Make sure that these lines are called before your own task is added to that analysis manager, your task will depend on this task:\n// load the macro and add the task\nTMacro PIDadd(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_ROOT/ANALYSIS/macros/AddTaskPIDResponse.C\"));\nAliAnalysisTaskPIDResponse* PIDresponseTask = reinterpret_cast(PIDadd.Exec());\n\nthe above code snippet will work under ROOT6. If you are running ROOT5, the lines to use are a bit different:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"$ALICE_ROOT/ANALYSIS/macros/AddTaskPIDResponse.C\");\nAddTaskPIDResponse();\n\nAs a second step, you‚Äôll have to make some changed to the header of our analysis. First, you‚Äôll add another class member, which is a pointer to the AliPIDresponse object that we‚Äôll use in our class. To do this, remember how you added pointers to histograms earlier in this tutorial, so add\n\na forward declaration of the type, i.e. ‚Äòclass AliPIDResponse‚Äô\n\nthe pointer itself, i.e. ‚ÄòAliPIDResponse* fPIDResponse; //! pid response object‚Äô\n\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to add this new pointer fPIDResponse to the member initialization list in your class constructors (in the .cxx files)!\nAfter making changes to the header, you can add the actual identification routine. This will be done in the implementation of the class. You need to go through a few steps:\n\nRetrieve the AliPIDResponse object from the analysis manager;\n\nmake our poiter ‚ÄòfPIDResponse‚Äô point to the AliPIDResponse object;\n\ninclude the header for the AliPIDResponse class, so that the compiler knows how it is defined\n\n\nThe code to do this might be a bit difficult to figure out by yourself, so it‚Äôs given here below\nAliAnalysisManager *man = AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager();\nif (man) {\n    AliInputEventHandler* inputHandler = (AliInputEventHandler*)(man->GetInputEventHandler());\n    if (inputHandler)   fPIDResponse = inputHandler->GetPIDResponse();\n}\n\nDo you understand\n\nwhat happens in each line?\n\nin which function (UserCreateOutputObjects, UserExcec, Terminate, etc) to put this code?\n\n\nNow that we‚Äôve retrieved our PID response object, it‚Äôs time to use it. To extract information for different particle species, you can use the functions\ndouble kaonSignal = fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kKaon);\ndouble pionSignal = fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kPion);\ndouble protonSignal = fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kProton);\n\nWhat these functions return you, is a probability that a particle is of a certain type, expressed in standard deviations (œÉ\\sigmaœÉ) . To identify a particle, we‚Äôll require that its PIDresponse signal lies withim 3 standard deviations of the expected signal. To check this, you can write a few lines such as\nif (std::abs(fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kPion)) \nPutting what you have read in practice\nUse the code snippets given in the above sections to implement your particle identification routines. If you are confident that can ‚Äôisolate‚Äô the pions, create new histograms to store the pion‚Äôs\n\ntransverse momentum\n\npseudorapidity\n\nazimuthal angle\n\n\nCentrality\nMost heavy-ion analyses report their results in intervals of collision centrality. In order to access collision centrality within your analysis, you will have to add yet another task to the chain of tasks that is called in your run macro. This third task also needs to be executed prior your own task (note, that the procedure for obtaining centrality for run 1 data can be different - when in doubt, ask your supervisor). The task, called AliMultSelectionTask, can be added to the manager using the following instructions:\n    TMacro multSelection(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/COMMON/MULTIPLICITY/macros/AddTaskMultSelection.C\"));\n    AliMultSelectionTask* multSelectionTask = reinterpret_cast(multSelection.Exec());\n\nor, using the ROOT5 equivalent\n    gROOT->LoadMacro(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/COMMON/MULTIPLICITY/macros/AddTaskMultSelection.C\");\n    AliMultSelectionTask* multSelectionTask = AddTaskMultSelection(kFALSE);\n\nTo access centrality within your analysis task, you need to obtain a pointer to the AliMultSelection object, and obtain the collision centrality through this object, e.g. by doing\n    Float_t centrality(0);\n    AliMultSelection *multSelection =static_cast(fAOD->FindListObject(\"MultSelection\"));\n    if(multSelection) centrality = multSelection->GetMultiplicityPercentile(\"V0M\");\n\nUsing the above code snippets, can you select pions in 0-10% centrality, and 50-60% centrality? Does the number of pions change in the way you would expect them to change ?\n"},"analysis/MC.html":{"url":"analysis/MC.html","title":"Step 6 -Using Monte Carlo data","keywords":"","body":"Monte Carlo events\nA large fraction of our recorded data is accompanied by simulated events that we call Monte Carlo (MC) productions. Different MC generators, like PYTHIA, DPMJET, and HIJING are used to simulate collisions, after which a detector response is simulated using GEANT. \nThe main reason for analyzing MC events is that it enables the analyzer to calculate efficiency and acceptance corrections specific for their analysis, and study the difference between the true and reconstructed observables. So, in MC, we have by construction more information available. In MC, we can for example just ask the PDG code of the particles in the event, and then verify how well our data analysis performs. \nAccessing MC productions\nFirst, we have to download the MC data. Since we downloaded Pb-Pb data from the period LHC15o with run number 246757, we will download an AOD file from the same run of a MC that is anchored to this period; namely LHC16g1.\naliensh\ncd /alice/sim/2016/LHC16g1/246757/AOD198/0002/\ncp AliAOD.root file:.\n\nIt might be useful to rename the file to AliAOD_MC.root to avoid confusion later on.

But of course we want to and can do more!\nAccessing the MC information\nWe will add a few things to our code to be able to obtain information that is provided directly by the Monte Carlo generator itself (often referred to as 'true level' or 'generator level'). First, we add our new global variable to the header in the list of private objects:\nAliMCEvent*             fMCEvent;       //! corresponding MC event\n\nThen we add fMCEvent to the constructors\n...\nAliAnalysisTaskMyTask::AliAnalysisTaskMyTask() : AliAnalysisTaskSE(), \n    fAOD(0), fMCEvent(0), fOutputList(0), fHistPt(0)\n{\n...\n\nand\n...\nAliAnalysisTaskMyTask::AliAnalysisTaskMyTask(const char* name) : AliAnalysisTaskSE(name),\n    fAOD(0), fMCEvent(0), fOutputList(0), fHistPt(0)\n{\n...\n\nIn UserExec we can now use our new global variable to obtain the MC event through the MCEvent method\nfMCEvent = MCEvent();\n\nNow let's use the information by creating a new function that loops over the MC particles:\nin the header file we declare our new function ProcessMCParticles\nvoid ProcessMCParticles();\n\nThen we put the implementation in the .cxx file:\nvoid AliAnalysisTaskMyTask::ProcessMCParticles()\n{\n    // process MC particles\n    TClonesArray* AODMCTrackArray = dynamic_cast(fInputEvent->FindListObject(AliAODMCParticle::StdBranchName()));\n    if (AODMCTrackArray == NULL) return;\n\n    // Loop over all primary MC particle\n    for(Long_t i = 0; i GetEntriesFast(); i++) {\n\n      AliAODMCParticle* particle = static_cast(AODMCTrackArray->At(i));\n      if (!particle) continue;\n      cout GetPdgCode() \nFinally we call our newly created function in UserExec:\nif(fMCEvent) ProcessMCParticles();\n\nYou can run the code and enjoy the list of PDG code values of each particle in the MC event... although it might be more useful to fill a histogram with the values instead of printing them to the terminal.\n"},"analysis/grid.html":{"url":"analysis/grid.html","title":"Step 7 -Run your code on GRID","keywords":"","body":"Step 7\nIs your pion analysis running smoothly on your laptop?

It provides a command line interface as ROOT5, and runs macros just\nlike under ROOT5. Therefore it is possible to build and run the ALICE\nsimulation, reconstruction and analysis framework under ROOT6. AliPhysics can be\nbuilt against ROOT6 in the following way:\naliBuild -z --defaults root6 build AliPhysics\n\nFor classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics this transition is transparent. For code in\nmacros there are however a few difference. This page tries to summarize the\ndifferences in behaviour observed so far and gives some suggestions how to solve\nthese issues so work can go on smoothly under ROOT6.\nWhat is a just-in-time compiler?\nFor the command line interface and running macros ROOT5 uses CINT, which is an\ninterpreter for C/C++. An interpreter processes a macro line-by-line. It depends\non the implementation of the interpreter how C++ code will be handled and how\nclose the interpretation comes to the language standard. ROOT5 allows for some\ndeviations from the language standards, which means that some coding errors\nwhich would thrown by a compiler leading in a break of the compilation are still\ntolerated by ROOT5. Furthermore the standard library is not fully supported as\nits handling has to be implemented into the compiler. Macro can however also be\nrun in the compiled mode by ROOT5 (adding a \"+\" to the macro name). In this case\nROOT calls an external compiler to compile the macro to a library which is loaded\ninto ROOT. Once the macro runs in compiled mode it is expected to be fully\ncompatible with the C++ standard and coding error free as the compiler will not\ntolerate compiler errors.\nIn contrast to this ROOT6 uses a just-in-time compiler called cling. A\njust-in-time compiler translates each statement, no matter whether it is a single\ncommand or a complicated macro, into machine code as it would be a program and\nonly afterwards runs this piece of code. In order to translate code into machine\ncode the compiler must know how to translate every single line. Based on powerful\ncompiler library this means for ROOT6 that all macro must comply to 100% with\nthe C++ language standard, and exceptions will not be tolerated. Furthermore this\nalso means that all symbols and objects must be known at compile time. This has\nthree side effects:\n\nLoading Functions with gROOT->LoadMacro(...);: This function loads all\nfunctions it finds within the macro into ROOT during run time. For an interpreter\nthis is sufficient as the functions are used after they are loaded. However the\ncompiler must know all symbols used in a macro at compile time.\nLoading libraries with gSystem->Load(...);: Here we have the same problem:\nThe symbols in the libraries must be known before they are used.\nCompiling ALICE analysis tasks on the fly with gROOT->LoadMacro(\"...+\");:\nAs the analysis task compiled like this will be converted in a library it must be\nknow to the just-in-time compiler before.\n\nFor all three cases exist workarounds which will be discussed in the next\nsections. In general macros which were running under ROOT5 in the compiled mode\nwill also run under ROOT6. Macros which were running only in the interpreted\nmode might contain coding errors which were not handled by ROOT5 and might\ntherefore need fixes. However the just-in-time compiler will give precise error\nmessages leading exactly to the lines which need fixes.\nHow can I call macros inside macros?\nCalling macros inside macros is a bit tricky as the result of a macro will be\navailable only at runtime. There are however several workarounds which cover the \nmost common use cases:\n\nUsing ROOT's TMacro:\nTMacro is a wrapper class around the macro processing. It is constructed with\nthe macro path. The macro is run using TMacro::Exec. The result of\nTMacro::Exec() is a number representing an address in memory where to\nfind the resulting object. This has to be cast into a pointer to an object of\nthe expected type. Example:\nTMacro physseladd(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"));\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(physseladd.Exec());\n\nThe macro is still evaluated at runtime, however with the reinterpret_cast to\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask * we tell ROOT that the result of the macro\ninterpretation must be of type AliPhysicsSelectionTask *, so the type is known\nat compile time. TMacro::Exec optionally gets a string representation of the\nfunction arguments. This might be a bit complicated to handle, particularly if\nthe arguments are dynamic and change at run time. The method works both for\nROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nUsing gROOT/gInterpreter->ProcessLine: \nMacro execution can be launched as well via gROOT->ProcessLine() /\ngInterpreter->ProcessLine(). As with TMacro this method is focused on running\na macro and not loading content from it. The ProcessLine method returns a\nlong number representing an address in memory where to find the output objects.\nThis number has to be cast to the expected output type using a\nreinterpret_cast in order to access the content of the output objects. The\nfollowing example runs the add macro for the physics selection task:\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(gInterpreter->ProcessLine(Form(\".x %s\", gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"))))\n\nAdding function arguments is possible here as well as a simple string\nrepresentation after the macro path, surrounded with (). This method also works\nboth under ROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nIncluding macros:\nAs ROOT6 compiles the macro it is possible to include macros and treat them\nas if they were header files. In order for this to work it is essential to tell\nROOT before where to find the macro. This can be done using the preprocessor\nmacro R_ADD_INCLUDE_PATH(...). For the just-in-time compiler macros\nincluded will look as if they were part of the code itself. The following macro\nruns under ROOT6:\n#ifdef __CLING__\n// Tell  ROOT where to find AliRoot headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_ROOT)\n#include \n\n// Tell ROOT where to find AliPhysics headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_PHYSICS)\n#include \n#endif\n\nvoid simpleaddtest(){\n  AliAnalysisManager *mgr = new AliAnalysisManager;\n\n  // Take function from macro AddESDHandler\n  // no gROOT->LoadMacro for ROOT6\n  AddESDHandler();\n\n  AliPhysicsSelectionTask *test = AddTaskPhysicsSelection(kTRUE);\n\n  mgr->InitAnalysis();\n  mgr->PrintStatus();\n}\n\nIn particular when passing arguments to the macro (in the example above passing\nkTRUE to AddTaskPhysicsSelection) this method is very convenient. This method\nis specific to ROOT6. The part including macros has to be protected (see\nbelow).\n\n\nDo I need to include header files in my macros?\nROOT6 comes with a technique called pre-compiled header files. Header files\nfrom a certain library are compiled to a binary format by rootcling, the\nsuccessor of rootcint, and loaded into ROOT6 by an auto-loading mechanism\nsimilar to the rootmap mechanism. Once rootcling is invoked with the\nargument -rml name a .pcm-file is created containing the pre-compiled\nheaders. ROOT6 will search for .pcm-files in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nThe following packages in ALICE provide .pcm support:\n\nAliRoot\nAliPhysics\nRooUnfold\nFairRoot\no2\n\nFor libraries providing .pcm-support NO headers should be included in macros.\nFor libraries handled by the user make sure to\n\nrun rootcling with the arguments -rmf for the .rootmap file\nand -rml for the .pcm file\nInstall both the .rootmap and the .pcm file of your library path in the \nlibrary location (usually PROJECT_PATH/lib)\n\nI get a huge amount of errors, and my macro doesn't run. What can I do?\nHere are few examples that commonly appear in user macros and which are tolerated by ROOT5 but not anymore by ROOT6:\n\nUndefined symbols:\nMaybe you have something like this in your code:\ntaskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThe variable taskname was not defined before. It was implicitly defined in ROOT5 as const char *. In ROOT6 this leads to the error\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'taskname'\nThe variable taskname must be defined with a type before a value can be assigned. In this case the proper code would be\nconst char *taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThanks to C++11 ROOT6 can also detect the type implicitly using the keyword\nauto. In this case the code looks the following:\nauto taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThis will however not be transparent to ROOT5 as ROOT5 doesn't understand\nC++11.\nNote: On the command line ROOT6 automatically adds the auto keyword. The \nstatement above will be possible in the interpreted mode of ROOT6.\n\nMissing forward declarations\nConsider this macro:\nvoid fail_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nUnder ROOT5 this macro will run, but under ROOT6 it will raise the following compiler error:\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'test'\nThe function test is defined, but after it is used. In ROOT5 this is\nno problem: During interpretation the interpreter loads all functions. But\nunder ROOT6 the macro is compiled, and now the order matters: Functions need\nto be declared before they are used. Adding a forward declaration is \nsufficient in order to make the macro working. The following version of\nthe macro will run also under ROOT6:\nint test(int a, int b);\n\nvoid run_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nHandling of pointer and objects:\nROOT5 does not enforce using the proper access operator for objects, pointers and\nreferences, but will allow the usage of the operator -> for\nreferences and the operator . for pointers. ROOT6 distinguishes\nbetween them, and consequently the proper access operator needs to be used.\nConsider the following macro:\nvoid fail_access(){\n  TH1F *ptr = new TH1F(\"ptr\", \"ptr\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  ptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n\n  TH1F obj(\"obj\", \"obj\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj.GetTitle());\n}\n\nConsequently the wrong access operator is used. ROOT5 will warn about the\nincorrect access operator, but it will run the macro. Trying this under ROOT6\nends in the following errors:\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\nptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  ~~~^\n     ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^\n                             ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  ~~~^~\n     .\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj->GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^~\n                             .\n\n\nI get a huge amount of unknown symbols from classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics? Do I still need to include header files?\nIn case the compilation of a macro under ROOT6 fails libraries and pre-compiled\nheaders from external packages are not loaded. The consequence is that ROOT6\ndoes not know about these classes and will raise errors about unknown symbols.\nOnce all the initial compiler errors are fixed (usually at the very top of\nthe error log), the next time the macros are compiled ROOT6 will also load the\nlibraries and .pch files from external libraries and the errors disappear. Header\nfrom ALICE libraries should NOT be included.\nHow do I distinguish between ROOT5 and ROOT6 in my macros?\nSometimes macros require different treatment for ROOT5 and ROOT6. It is then\nnecessary to know which ROOT version is used while the macro is running.\nROOT5 defines the preprocessor macro __CINT__, which can be used to check\nwhether one is in an interpreter session. In current (up to at least v6-12-04)\nhowever also ROOT6 exports __CINT__, so this macro cannot be used to\ndistinguish between ROOT versions.\nROOT6 in addition __CLING__ which is not present in ROOT5. The following lines \nindicate how to run ROOT5/ROOT6 specific code:\n#if defined(__CLING__)\n  // ROOT6-specific code here ...\n#elif defined(__CINT__)\n  // ROOT5-specific code here ...\n#endif\n\nI heard TF1 has changed fundamentally. Is there something to be aware of?\nTF1 is based on TFormula for the formula representation. TFormula got a heavy\nchange: In ROOT5 formulas were always interpreted on-the-fly. With ROOT6 they\nare compiled by the just-in-time compiler. While this leads to a significant\nspeedup in particular when the formula is evaluated multiple times (in fit\nprocedures for example) it comes on cost of breaking backward compatibility, for\nwhich reading TFormula/TF1 object created with ROOT6 with ROOT5 will lead to\nerrors. For what concerns TFormala a ROOT5-compatible version has been added to\nROOT6 as ROOT::v5::TFormula, however something similar does not exist for\nTF1. In order to read a TF1 object from a ROOT file under ROOT5 it has to be\ncreated under ROOT5.\nNow my macro finally works under ROOT6. Will it still work under ROOT5?\nIt depends whether the macro now contains something which ROOT5 does NOT\nunderstand.\n\nROOT6 is fully compatible with C++11. In ROOT5 C++11 support is not\nimplemented, but the standard C++98 is used. C++11-specific code will not\nbe understood.\nAll NEW features provided by ROOT6 are of course not ported to ROOT5.\nThis in particular affects:\nTTreeReader\nTProcPool\nTDataFrame\n...\n\n\nStandard library support in ROOT5, while it comes out-if-the-box in ROOT6.\nIf the macro should run under both ROOT versions consider ROOT containers\ninstead.\nIf your classes write stl-containers containing ROOT-objects to a ROOT-file \nthey must be declared to ROOT5 in your LinkDef.h file. Example:#pragma link C++ class std::vector+;\n\nFor ROOT6 this is not necessary.\n\n\n\n"}}}
